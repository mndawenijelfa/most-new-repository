<h1>welcome to my first website</h1>

<h2>this website is just me trying out my coding skills.</h2>

<h2>you are allowed to rate me out of ten </h2>

<p>well this is my first time ever coding .i dont have experience with it but i am enjoying it.every new topic has been more challenging than the last one but intresting </p>

<p>being a website developer was never part of my career choice but now i think it is because i had no knowledge about it</p>
